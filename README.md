# Syn
This is a programming language I made. It is interpreted.

## this is the early interpreted version.
This version of Syn is no longer being updated. It will be updated to the Syn compiler. there is no point in adding a documentation because it lacks functionality. At the moment the Syn/Syn+ compiler is still heavily in development, so it will take a while before its finished. There will be another interpreted version that will be made in C++, WITHOUT the tutorial series from @sebbekarlsson, and will be made by me alone or with anyone willing to work on it.

## Changelog 2/26/24:
I decided to commit the last version of the language that I made in April of last year that adds some new things. It changes "print" to "output" and "function" to just "func". These two changes are going to be carried over to the Syn+ and Syn 2.0 syntaxes. It also adds "clear" and "exit" functions. This is the last official update to the Syn Programming Language.
