# Syn
This is a programming language I made. It uses an interpreter.
# this is the early/interpreted version.
> this version of Syn is no longer being updated. it will be updated to the Syn compiler.
> there is no point in adding a documentation because it lacks functionality.
> at the moment the Syn/Syn+ compiler is still heavily in development, so it will take a while before its finished.
